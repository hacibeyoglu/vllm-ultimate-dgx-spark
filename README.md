**One container, the whole fleet.** A single image — `ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest` — serves every AEON model on **NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, sm_121a)** and other consumer-Blackwell GPUs (RTX 50 series): **Gemma-4-26B-A4B**, **Qwen3.6-27B**, and **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** all run on the same build, with DFlash speculative decoding, NVFP4 weights, NVFP4/FP8 KV cache, and the OpenAI-compatible gateway intact.

Built on **vLLM v0.23.0 compiled from source for sm_121a**, merged with the AEON speculative-decoding stack: Triton software **NVFP4 KV cache** (PR #44389) + **DFlash SWA / high-concurrency / prefix-cache fixes** (PR #40898, #41703, #43982-port) + the **AEON DGX Spark runtime patches** + **TurboQuant** + **DFlash speculative decoding**.

> 🆕 **2026-06-18 — `:latest` is now the v0.23.0 sm_121a build (`:2026-06-18-v0.23.0-dflashfix`).** Rebuilt from source on vLLM v0.23.0 as a 3-way merge that preserves the AEON spec-decode tree, and adds the **DFlash high-concurrency fix** (port of upstream PR #43982): the drafter previously **crashed at ≥32 concurrent requests** under speculative decoding (padded-vs-unpadded KV block-table shape mismatch) and now scales cleanly to **c=64**. Carries the still-open PR #44389 (NVFP4-KV), #40898 (DFlash SWA), #41703 (prefix-cache corruption). See [What we fixed for the DGX Spark](#what-we-fixed-for-the-dgx-spark) and the [v0.23.0 fleet benchmarks](#v0230-fleet-benchmarks--one-image-three-models). Rollback tag: `:2026-06-11-pr41703`.

## What's inside

| Component | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **vLLM** | 0.23.0 + sm_121a build, AEON spec-decode 3-way merge | Built from source for GB10; carries PR #44389 (Triton NVFP4 KV) + #40898 (DFlash SWA) + #41703 (prefix-cache corruption) + #43982-port (DFlash high-concurrency fix, new 2026-06-18) |
| **PyTorch** | 2.11.0+cu130 | CUDA 13.0 with sm_121a (DGX Spark / GB10) compute capability |
| **transformers** | 5.10.0.dev0 (HEAD) | Recognizes `gemma4_unified`, `qwen3_5`, all bleeding-edge model classes |
| **flashinfer** | 0.6.12 | NVFP4 GEMM kernels, sliding-window attention, MLA, custom attention |
| **TurboQuant** | 0.2.0 (AEON-7 fork) | CUDA-graph-safe QJL — 4-bit KV compression on top of vLLM's native KV cache |
| **modelopt** | available via pip if needed | Quantization framework (not bundled — image stays small for serving) |

## v0.23.0 fleet benchmarks — one image, three models

The whole point of this container is that **a single build runs the entire AEON fleet** on a DGX Spark. The three charts below are the *same* `ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest` (vLLM 0.23.0 + AEON sm_121a + DFlash) serving three very different architectures — a Gemma-4 MoE, a Qwen3.6 hybrid GDN+attention dense model, and a Qwen3.6 A3B MoE — each scaling cleanly from 1 to **64 concurrent requests** with no crash (the pre-fix image died at c≥32 under speculative decoding).

Numbers are measured on **DGX Spark GB10 (sm_121a)** with DFlash speculative decoding, NVFP4 weights, FP8 KV cache, prefix caching on, p50 across ≥ samples per point.

### Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Uncensored (NVFP4)

That long-context acceptance hold is the SWA-fix win (PR #40898) — earlier images collapsed past ~2k tokens.

vs a **stock vanilla `vllm/vllm-openai:nightly` baseline of ~10.5 tok/s** (no DFlash, no sm_121a optimizations) → optimized hits **~38–56 tok/s by category ≈ 4–5× single-stream** decode.

> **About the stock baseline:** the "stock / un-optimized" comparison figure is from **stock vanilla vLLM** (default settings, no DFlash, no DGX-Spark / sm_121a optimizations — `vllm/vllm-openai:nightly` eager). It is **provisional and will be refreshed** once a fresh fully-vanilla benchmark completes on the current version. The optimized figures above are measured on the new `aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest` (vLLM 0.23.0) build. There is no published vanilla baseline for the 35B-A3B yet (pending re-bench).

## What we fixed for the DGX Spark

All three models above run on one unified container — **`ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest`** (= `:2026-06-18-v0.23.0-dflashfix`; rollback `:2026-06-11-pr41703`) — vLLM v0.23.0 built from source for GB10 / sm_121a and merged with the AEON speculative-decoding stack. This is the centerpiece of the build: a set of fixes that take the default "it runs, but it crashes under load and drafting collapses on long context" behavior and turn it into a stable, long-context, high-concurrency local-agent server.

| Fix | What it does | Why it matters on GB10 |
|---|---|---|
| **DFlash high-concurrency fix** *(new 2026-06-18)* | Slices the speculative drafter's KV block-table to the unpadded batch (`block_table[:num_reqs]`) | The drafter previously **crashed at ≥32 concurrent requests** (padded-vs-unpadded block-table shape mismatch in FlashAttention varlen — the engine died at c=64 with `block_table must have shape …`). Now scales cleanly to **c=64**. A port of upstream PR #43982, which fixed this for MTP but never for DFlash — present and unfixed even in the prior image. |
| **Triton NVFP4 KV cache** (PR #44389) | Software NVFP4 KV-cache path | The **only** 4-bit KV path on sm_121a (upstream's is hard-gated to B200) → **~3× KV capacity** / longer context per GB of unified memory. |
| **DFlash sliding-window attention** (PR #40898) | Runs the drafter's SWA layers as true sliding-window | **Long-context draft acceptance holds** as agent histories grow (e.g. Gemma-26B Coding ≈ 59% at ~16k, ≈ 47% at ~33k) instead of collapsing past ~2k tokens. |
| **Prefix-cache corruption immunity** (PR #41703) | Masks rejected/invalid context KV slots so they are never written | Without it, `--enable-prefix-caching` + DFlash silently decays draft acceptance to **0% over minutes-to-hours** of traffic (engine-global, ~6× slowdown that only a restart healed). With it, prefix caching is **safe again under sustained production load**. |
| **sm_121a-native build** | `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1a`, `ENABLE_NVFP4_SM100=0` | Compiles the **SM120-family CUTLASS NVFP4/FP8 kernels** GB10 actually dispatches to — true 4-bit tensor-core throughput, no dead B200-only kernels. |
| **sm_121a boot + CUDA-graph patches** | RTLD-lazy `_C_stable_libtorch` load; spec-decode CUDA-graph capture-size alignment | Boots past MXFP4 (SM100-only) symbols absent on GB10; prevents `cudaErrorIllegalAddress` on partial-acceptance decode steps under speculative decoding. |
| **Unified-memory tuning** | `--gpu-memory-utilization ≤0.70–0.88`, FULL CUDA graphs, async scheduling, z-lab DFlash drafters | GB10 shares one LPDDR5X pool across CPU + GPU; conservative KV headroom avoids page-thrash while keeping FULL-graph + speculative-decode throughput. |

### The result

- **Scales to 64 concurrent requests** with no crash — the same image, on all three fleet models (the prior image crashed at c≥32 under speculative decoding).
- **Native NVFP4 4-bit compute** on Blackwell tensor cores — the speed of 4-bit with near-16-bit accuracy.
- **Speculative decoding (DFlash)** holds high draft acceptance from short prompts through long (16k–32k) agent histories.
- Roughly **4–5× faster single-stream decode** vs a stock un-optimized vanilla vLLM baseline (Qwen3.6-27B: ~10.5 → ~38–56 tok/s by category; provisional pending a fresh vanilla re-bench).

## Why this container for Blackwell + DGX Spark users

### 🚀 NVFP4 KV cache — up to **3× KV capacity** (Triton software path)
PR #44389 (lesj0610/vllm) adds a Triton software path that packs the KV cache as **E2M1 FP4 + E4M3 block scales**. Enable per-serve via `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4`. Independent of native FP4 conversion instructions — works on any sm_120 / sm_121 / sm_100 / sm_90 GPU.

When activated:
- **3× KV cache capacity** on Qwen3.6-27B and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (per PR author benchmarks)
- MRCR quality comparable to `auto` KV baseline — closer than TurboQuant 4bit_nc

Not activated by default. Pass `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4` to opt in.

### 🛠️ AEON DGX Spark patches (sm_121a runtime fixes)

The container ships with our 3 idempotent runtime patches that ensure correctness on GB10 hardware until upstream fixes land:

| Patch | What it fixes |
|---|---|
| **patch_cuda_optional_import** | Wraps `import vllm._C_stable_libtorch` in `RTLD_LAZY` so the SM100-only `mxfp4_experts_quant` and `silu_and_mul_mxfp4_experts_quant` symbols are tolerated as unresolved until first call (they never fire on sm_121a workloads) |
| **patch_cudagraph_align** | Drops the `cudagraph_mode==FULL`-only gate on the spec-decode capture-size alignment filter in `config/compilation.py` so PIECEWISE mode also rounds capture sizes to multiples of `(1 + num_speculative_tokens)` — eliminates `cudaErrorIllegalAddress` mid-decode on partial-acceptance steps |

All patches are idempotent — they no-op when upstream merges the equivalent fix.

### 🩹 DFlash drafter correctness fixes (PR #40898 + #41703, merged ahead of upstream)

Both PRs are **open upstream but required** for correct DFlash operation (the z-lab drafter README pins them); the v0.23.0 `:latest` build carries them in-tree (3-way merged), alongside the new DFlash high-concurrency fix (PR #43982 port). They fix three real defects we root-caused in production on DGX Spark:

| Defect | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Rejected-token context-KV writes** — the `copy_and_expand_dflash_inputs_kernel` stored slot mappings for *rejected* draft tokens, writing garbage K/V into the drafter's paged KV cache (incl. shared blocks). With `--enable-prefix-caching` the corruption was **persistent and self-accelerating** | Draft acceptance decays 34–56% → **0.0%** over minutes-to-hours of traffic (scales with volume); sticky engine-global; ~6× decode slowdown (144 → 24 tok/s) that only a restart healed | #41703 masks rejected/invalid context slots (`-1`) so they are never written |
| **Drafter sliding-window ignored** — SWA drafters (e.g. the Gemma-4-26B drafter: 4 of 5 layers SWA-2048) ran all layers as full attention | Long-context requests (>2048 tok history) got ~0% acceptance *per-request* even on a healthy server | #40898 adds DFlash SWA support (per-layer sliding-window wiring + causal SWA drafting metadata) |
| **Missing Gemma-4 adapter pieces** — no sqrt(hidden) embedding normalizer or final-logit softcapping in the draft path; `flash_attn` drafter rejected on multimodal Gemma targets | Depressed acceptance ceiling (MAL 4.4–6.6 vs z-lab's published 6.1–8.6); forced onto `flex_attention` | #41703 adds both + `use_mm_prefix=False`, enabling the upstream-tested **`flash_attn` drafter** on Gemma-4 |

⚠️ **Recipe change on this image: the DFlash drafter must use `"attention_backend": "flash_attn"`.** The old `flex_attention` workaround crashes at the first request (`key_cache.view(...)` on a non-contiguous tensor — the PR's KV-sharing machinery is only exercised with flash_attn upstream). With these fixes, `--enable-prefix-caching` is **safe again with DFlash** — soak-validated under production fleet traffic.

### 🧠 TurboQuant K8V4 — 4-bit KV cache compression
[0xSero/turboquant](https://github.com/0xSero/turboquant) with the AEON-7 fork applying our [`fix/cuda-graph-safe-qjl-powers`](https://github.com/AEON-7/turboquant/tree/fix/cuda-graph-safe-qjl-powers) patch — caches the `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]` constant per-device once at module load instead of re-allocating per call. **Without this fix, TurboQuant crashes at boot during CUDA graph capture**; the lazy workaround `--enforce-eager` costs ~30% throughput.

Enable per-serve via `--kv-cache-dtype tq_k8v4`.

### ⚡ DFlash speculative decoding (native via `--speculative-config`)
DFlash and EAGLE3 drafters are supported natively via vLLM's `--speculative-config` flag — no extra package needed since vLLM 0.21. Pair with our [aeon-7 DFlash drafters on HF](https://huggingface.co/AEON-7/DFlash-Qwen3.5-27B-Uncensored) for 1.5-2.5× throughput on the Qwen3.x family.

### 🔬 Native Blackwell SM 12.1 sm_121a compute
Built for `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="12.1a"` — the sm_121a target for the GB10 in DGX Spark. Also runs on RTX 5090 / RTX 5080 / RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (sm_120) thanks to the same family matcher in vLLM main.

## Quick start

The canonical target is the **AEON-7 Qwen3.6 family** — see [Validated models](#validated-models) below. Pick the variant that matches your hardware, then follow the matching recipe.

### Pull the image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest
# or pin the current build (vLLM 0.23.0 + DFlash high-concurrency fix)
docker pull ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:2026-06-18-v0.23.0-dflashfix

```

### Recipe A — DGX Spark, DFlash drafter + FP8 KV (recommended for daily-driver)

This is the **measured-best config** for DGX Spark per the AEON-7 Qwen3.6 routing memo: on the **Qwen3.6-27B MTP-XS body**, the **DFlash drafter beats the MTP-method by +56 % median / +150 % peak** on Spark's unified-memory GB10 (measured 2026-04-28). Note this is a 27B-XS-body result — **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B is at parity** (no DFlash win; its 8-layer all-full-attention drafter draws even with MTP-style decoding).

> ⚠️ **DFlash + NVFP4 KV is not yet compatible on sm_121a (still true on the v0.23.0 build).** The DFlash drafter uses non-causal attention (parallel candidate generation), and none of the currently-built backends pair non-causal with NVFP4 KV on Spark:
> - `FLASH_ATTN` — doesn't support NVFP4 KV
> - `FLASHINFER` — supports NVFP4 KV but requires **SM100** (we're on SM121)
> - `TRITON_ATTN` — supports NVFP4 KV but is **causal-only**
>
> Use **`--kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3`** with DFlash. NVFP4 KV works cleanly with causal speculators (`mtp`, `qwen3_5_mtp`, `eagle3`, `ngram`) — see Recipe B.

#### Step 1 — download the base + DFlash drafter

```bash
# 1) Base — compressed-tensors NVFP4 + DFlash production variant (26 GB)
huggingface-cli download \
  AEON-7/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-NVFP4 \
  --local-dir /models/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-NVFP4

# 2) DFlash drafter — z-lab's 5-layer Qwen3.6 drafter (3.3 GB)
huggingface-cli download \
  z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash \
  --local-dir /models/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash-drafter
```

> ⚠️ **Materialize the drafter dir.** If `huggingface-cli` stores symlinks into the HF cache blob dir, vLLM's bind-mounted container can't follow them. Either pass `--local-dir-use-symlinks=False` (newer hf_hub) or `cp -L $HF_CACHE/snapshots/<hash>/* /models/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash-drafter/` so the files are real.

#### Step 2 — serve with DFlash + NVFP4 KV

```bash
docker run -d --name aeon-vllm \
    --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=16g \
    --net=host \
    -v /models/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-NVFP4:/model:ro \
    -v /models/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash-drafter:/drafter:ro \
    --entrypoint vllm \
    ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest \
    serve /model \
        --served-model-name aeon \
        --dtype auto \
        --quantization compressed-tensors \
        --kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3 \
        --max-model-len 24576 \
        --max-num-seqs 8 \
        --max-num-batched-tokens 8192 \
        --gpu-memory-utilization 0.78 \
        --enable-chunked-prefill \
        --enable-prefix-caching \
        --mamba-block-size 256 \
        --speculative-config '{"method":"dflash","model":"/drafter","num_speculative_tokens":4}' \
        --trust-remote-code
```

**Key flags**:
- `--quantization compressed-tensors` — the NVFP4 production model is in compressed-tensors format (`format: nvfp4-pack-quantized`), not modelopt. Use `--quantization modelopt` for the `*-MTP-XS` variants.
- `--kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3` — DFlash is non-causal and incompatible with NVFP4 KV on Spark today (see Recipe B for NVFP4 KV with MTP).
- `--speculative-config '{"method":"dflash",...}'` — `method: "dflash"` is the native vLLM speculator (not `"speculators"`).
- `--max-num-batched-tokens 8192` — must accommodate `num_speculative_tokens × max_num_seqs` plus headroom (vLLM warns if too low).
- `--mamba-block-size 256` — needed for Qwen3.6's hybrid GatedDeltaNet + attention stack.
- `--gpu-memory-utilization` — **keep this ≤ 0.88 on DGX Spark.** vLLM v0.23.0 defaults to `0.92`, but GB10's unified LPDDR5X pool is shared between CPU and GPU, so anything above ~0.88 page-thrashes. The recipes here use `0.78`/`0.68`; never set it higher than `0.88`.

> 💡 **Drafter materialization note.** vLLM bind-mounts the drafter dir but can't follow symlinks that point **outside** the mount (e.g. into the HF cache `blobs/` dir). After `huggingface-cli download`, either pass `--local-dir-use-symlinks=False` *or* `cp -L $HF_CACHE/snapshots/<hash>/* /models/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash-drafter/` so the files are real, not symlinks. This pitfall cost us 4 startup failures.

### Recipe B — MTP self-speculation + NVFP4 KV (capacity-bound workloads)

For workloads where **KV capacity is the bottleneck** (long context, many concurrent streams), use the modelopt MTP-XS body with NVFP4 KV cache. This is the only Spark recipe that exercises PR #44389's ~3× KV capacity gain today.

```bash
docker run -d --name aeon-vllm \
    --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=16g --net=host \
    -v /models/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-MTP-XS:/model:ro \
    --entrypoint vllm \
    ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest \
    serve /model \
        --served-model-name aeon \
        --quantization modelopt \
        --kv-cache-dtype nvfp4 \
        --speculative-config '{"method":"qwen3_5_mtp","num_speculative_tokens":3}' \
        --max-model-len 32768 --max-num-seqs 8 \
        --gpu-memory-utilization 0.78 \
        --enable-chunked-prefill --enable-prefix-caching --mamba-block-size 256 \
        --trust-remote-code
```

> ⚠️ **MTP throughput is lower than DFlash on Spark (Qwen3.6-27B).** Measured 2026-04-28 on the **Qwen3.6-27B MTP-XS body**: DFlash beats MTP by **+56 % median / +150 % peak** with the same XS body. (On **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** the two are at **parity** — its 8-layer all-full-attention drafter has no DFlash win.) Use MTP only when you need NVFP4 KV's ~3× capacity (long contexts or higher batch sizes) **and** can accept the lower throughput. For pure throughput on Spark, use Recipe A. For dedicated-VRAM Blackwell (RTX PRO 6000, B100/B200), MTP is the right choice everywhere.

### Recipe C — TurboQuant K8V4 (4-bit KV, extreme capacity)

```bash
docker run -d --name aeon-vllm \
    --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=16g --net=host \
    -e VLLM_USE_TURBOQUANT=1 \
    -e TURBOQUANT_KV_BITS=4 \
    -v /models/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-NVFP4:/model:ro \
    --entrypoint vllm \
    ghcr.io/aeon-7/aeon-vllm-ultimate:latest \
    serve /model \
        --quantization compressed-tensors \
        --kv-cache-dtype fp8 \
        --max-num-seqs 16 \
        ...
```

> ⚠️ **Cannot mix** TurboQuant K8V4 with `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4`. Pick one. K8V4 wins on raw capacity (4-bit K + 4-bit V); NVFP4 KV wins on quality at ~3× capacity.

## Benchmarks

> For the current **v0.23.0 per-model decode tables and 1→64 concurrency charts**, see [v0.23.0 fleet benchmarks](#v0230-fleet-benchmarks--one-image-three-models) above. The benchmarks below are **prior-image validation gates and config-selection A/Bs** (`2026-06-11-pr41703` and `2026-06-04` era) — kept for the DFlash-correctness story and the KV/speculator config comparison, which still hold on the v0.23.0 build.

### Gemma-4-26B-A4B + DFlash — DFlash-correctness validation gates (image `2026-06-11-pr41703`)

[AEON-7/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Uncensored-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/AEON-7/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Uncensored-NVFP4) + the z-lab `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-DFlash` drafter, production profile (`--gpu-memory-utilization 0.68 --max-model-len 184320 --max-num-seqs 32 --max-num-batched-tokens 32768 --enable-prefix-caching`, body `triton_attn`, drafter **`flash_attn`**, `num_speculative_tokens 10`). Validation gates measured before/after the PR #40898+#41703 fixes:

| Gate | pre-fix image | `2026-06-11-pr41703` |

| Long-context (~9k sys prompt) draft acceptance | ~0–7% (SWA defect) | **43.3% / MAL 5.3** |
| Prefix-caching ON + fleet-burst + 10-min production soak | acceptance collapses to 0% in ~25 min (corruption) | **52.0% / MAL 6.20** — *improves* under load |
| Single-stream coding (c=1, greedy) | 144 tok/s fresh-boot best, decaying to ~24 | **149–150 tok/s, sustained** |
| Long-context throughput | ~46 tok/s (APC unusable) | **78 tok/s** (APC accelerates the cached prefix) |
| Live production probe (voice fleet, post-deploy) | — | **60% acceptance / MAL 7.0** |

Mean acceptance length now lands in z-lab's published 6.1–8.6 range. KV at this profile: 726k tokens / 3.94× concurrency at 180k ctx. Serve command:

### 🏆 Production-style: greedy + n_spec=15, by prompt category

The headline single-stream config — **MTP-XS body + DFlash drafter (n_spec=15) + BF16 KV + greedy sampling** — on 24 prompts (4 per category), `max_tokens=400`:

| Category | n | TTFT median | TPOT median | decode tok/s mean | decode tok/s median | peak |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **math** | 4 | 243 ms | 22.3 ms | **44.6** | **44.9** | **45.7** ⚡ |
| code | 4 | 243 ms | 24.1 ms | 40.4 | 41.6 | 44.4 |
| reasoning | 4 | 195 ms | 28.4 ms | 35.9 | 35.2 | 40.1 |
| summary | 4 | 242 ms | 33.1 ms | 31.3 | 30.4 | 37.5 |
| dialogue | 4 | 243 ms | 33.4 ms | 30.0 | 30.1 | 36.6 |
| prose | 4 | 132 ms | 37.5 ms | 26.2 | 26.9 | 29.6 |
| **OVERALL** | **24** | **242 ms** | **29.3 ms** | **34.7** | **34.1** | **45.7** |

Concurrent ×4 streams (mixed categories):

| Round | Wall | Agg tok/s | TTFT mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 (cold) | 19.05 s | 71.5 | 1222 ms |
| **2 (steady)** | **17.57 s** | **84.4** | **276 ms** |

**Key findings**:
- **Math and code hit 41–46 tok/s** because token sequences are predictable — DFlash's n=15 acceptance window stays full.
- **Prose is slowest at ~26 tok/s** — high-entropy creative text means fewer drafter tokens accepted.
- **Per-category headline matches the v3 production card** (38.5 median / 71.3 peak, thinking-on) — math/code peak ~45 tok/s aligns with field reports.
- **n_spec=15 cuts KV concurrency in half** (146k tokens at 8k ctx, 17.9× max concurrent vs ~37× at n=4). Trade per-stream peak throughput for concurrency.

### Apples-to-apples 4-config comparison (sampled, n_spec=4 — same settings for all)

Same 8 generic prompts, `temperature=0.7`, `max_tokens=200`, `n_spec=4`. Use this when comparing **speculator method** or **KV dtype** at identical settings.

> **Provenance / status:** this 4-config A/B was measured on the **earlier `2026-06-04` era image** and is preserved here as the canonical *config-selection* baseline (speculator method × KV dtype, all else equal): the **FP8-E4M3 KV** config (**17.35 tok/s median single-stream**) vs the winning **DFlash + XS-body + BF16 KV** config (**24.27 tok/s**, +40%). These are *config-vs-config on the AEON container*, not a stock-vanilla comparison. The vanilla-vLLM baselines used in the fleet section above are **provisional and pending a fresh fully-vanilla re-benchmark** on the current v0.23.0 version.

### Single-stream (mean of 5 rounds)

### Concurrent × 4 streams (mean of 12 streams over 3 rounds)

| Config | Body | KV cache | TTFT median (steady) | TPOT mean | per-stream tok/s | aggregate peak |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MTP self-spec (n=1) | XS body | NVFP4 | 286 ms | 61.10 ms/tok | 15.71 | ~64 tok/s |
| MTP self-spec (n=1) | XS body | FP8-E4M3 | 239 ms | 60.17 ms/tok | 15.84 | ~66 tok/s |
| DFlash drafter (n=4) | NVFP4 body | BF16 (auto) | 328 ms | 55.39 ms/tok | 15.98 | ~68 tok/s |
| **🏆 DFlash drafter (n=4)** | **XS body** | **BF16 (auto)** | **476 ms¹ / 259 ms²** | **44.21 ms/tok** | **19.59** | **~87 tok/s** |

¹round 2 (warm)  ²round 3 (fully steady)

### Headlines

- **🏆 The winning config on Spark is the MTP-XS body + DFlash drafter (n=4) + BF16 KV.** Even though the body name says "MTP", it works great with an external DFlash drafter — and the **smaller body (21 GB vs 26 GB) leaves more compute and KV headroom**. Results: **+40% single-stream tok/s and +24% concurrent throughput vs the FP8-KV baseline.** Aggregate peak hits ~87 tok/s on 4 concurrent streams.
- DFlash on the NVFP4 (compressed-tensors) body is also a big win (+12% single, +0.9% concurrent) but the heavier 26 GB body loses ground to the same drafter on the lighter XS body.
- **MTP + NVFP4 KV** is the only path to PR #44389's ~3× KV capacity gain. Use when capacity (long context, more streams) outweighs the ~30-40% lower throughput vs DFlash. NVFP4 KV is within ±1% of FP8 on throughput at this prompt size; the real benefit is **~3× more KV blocks** at the same memory budget.
- **TPOT story is the cleanest signal.** DFlash + XS-body hits **40.8 ms/tok single-stream**, which is **28% faster than MTP** (57 ms) and **18% faster than DFlash on the heavier NVFP4 body** (50 ms). The drafter's n=4 acceptance and the smaller body's bandwidth advantage compound.
- **Round-1 concurrent TTFT (~1.5–4.6 s) is cold-cache + spec-decode warm-up.** Steady-state TTFT is rounds 2–3 (typically ~250–500 ms).

### KV cache capacity by body

| Body | GPU KV cache size at 8k ctx | Max concurrency |
|---|---:|---:|
| NVFP4 (compressed-tensors, 26 GB) + DFlash + BF16 KV | 264,922 tokens | 32.3× |
| XS (modelopt, 21 GB) + DFlash + BF16 KV | 300,966 tokens | 36.7× |

## Known issues (upstream vLLM)

These are **upstream PR #44389** or core-vLLM bugs that we **didn't introduce** and can't fix without substantial patching. They're documented here so users don't think the container is broken:

### NVFP4 KV cache requires a causal attention backend on SM121

PR #44389 lights up `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4` via the Triton software path, but the Triton backend is **causal-only**. The FlashInfer NVFP4 KV path requires SM100 — on SM121 it falls back to FP8.

Practical impact: NVFP4 KV pairs cleanly with **causal** speculators (`mtp`, `qwen3_5_mtp`, `eagle3`, `ngram`, `ngram_gpu`) but **not** with non-causal drafters like **DFlash**. If you pick `--kv-cache-dtype nvfp4` + `method:"dflash"`, vLLM raises:

```
ValueError: No valid attention backend found for cuda with AttentionSelectorConfig(...
  kv_cache_dtype=nvfp4, ..., use_non_causal=True). Reasons:
    FLASH_ATTN: [kv_cache_dtype not supported],
    FLASHINFER: [non-causal attention not supported, nvfp4 KV cache in FlashInfer requires SM100],
    TRITON_ATTN: [non-causal attention not supported],
    FLEX_ATTENTION: [kv_cache_dtype not supported],
    TURBOQUANT: [kv_cache_dtype not supported, non-causal attention not supported]
```

**Workaround for DFlash**: use **`--kv-cache-dtype auto`** (BF16). FP8 KV also fails for DFlash in this build because FLASHINFER and TRITON_ATTN both lost their non-causal kernel path in PR #44389's refactor:

```
ValueError: ... kv_cache_dtype=fp8_e4m3, ..., use_non_causal=True. Reasons:
  FLASH_ATTN: [kv_cache_dtype not supported]   (BF16 only)
  FLASHINFER:  [non-causal attention not supported]
  TRITON_ATTN: [non-causal attention not supported]
  FLEX_ATTENTION: [kv_cache_dtype not supported]
  TURBOQUANT: [kv_cache_dtype not supported, non-causal attention not supported]
```

This is a **current-state limitation of the v0.23.0 build on sm_121a**: DFlash's non-causal (parallel candidate) attention has no FP8/NVFP4 KV kernel partner on GB10 today — `FLASH_ATTN` is BF16-KV only, and both `FLASHINFER` and `TRITON_ATTN` dropped their non-causal path in PR #44389's refactor (FlashInfer's NVFP4 KV also needs SM100). NVFP4/FP8 KV will pair with DFlash once either (a) the Triton backend gains a non-causal kernel or (b) FLASHINFER's non-causal + FP8 path returns. Until then, run DFlash with **`--kv-cache-dtype auto`** (BF16), or use a causal speculator (Recipe B) for NVFP4 KV.

**Workaround for NVFP4 KV**: use a **causal** speculator (`mtp`, `qwen3_5_mtp`, `eagle3`, `ngram`, `ngram_gpu`) — see Recipe B. The Triton NVFP4-KV path supports those.


### Gemma-4-12B-AEON variants

| Variant | Issue |
|---|---|
| `Gemma-4-12B-AEON-Abliterated-K4-BF16` | vLLM's `TransformersMultiModalForCausalLM` fallback hits a shape mismatch on `Gemma4UnifiedForConditionalGeneration`. `RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (2048x4096 and 8192x3840)` in a linear projection during graph capture.

### Gemma-4-26B-A4B-NVFP4 — *badly-quantized vision-embedder variant only*

> This entry is specific to the **variant whose vision embedder was quantized**. The **correctly-quantized** [`Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Uncensored-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/AEON-7/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Uncensored-NVFP4) (vision embedder excluded as BF16) is **fleet-benchmarked and works** on the v0.23.0 `:latest` image — see the [fleet section](#v0230-fleet-benchmarks--one-image-three-models).

For the badly-quantized variant, vLLM creates the `embed_vision.embedding_projection` as a quantized `ReplicatedLinear`, but the checkpoint has only the unquantized `embed_vision.embedding_projection.weight` (because `embed_vision*` was excluded during quantization). Weight-loading mismatch. Likely an `exclude_modules` wildcard handling bug in PR #44389's refactor.

### For Gemma-4 production today

The **correctly-quantized** `Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-Uncensored-NVFP4` body + z-lab `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-DFlash` drafter is fleet-benchmarked on the current v0.23.0 `:latest` image (see the [fleet section](#v0230-fleet-benchmarks--one-image-three-models)). The variants in the table above (`Gemma-4-12B-AEON-*`, `Gemma-4-26B-A4B-NVFP4` with a quantized vision embedder) fail for **model-side** reasons that are independent of this container — they fail on any vLLM build.

## Build provenance

Current `:latest` (= `:2026-06-18-v0.23.0-dflashfix`) built 2026-06-18 on DGX Spark (GB10, 128 GB unified memory) — **vLLM v0.23.0 compiled from source for sm_121a** as a 3-way merge that preserves the AEON spec-decode tree (`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1a`, full CUDA compile). Carries the still-open upstream PRs #44389 (Triton NVFP4 KV), #40898 (DFlash SWA), #41703 (prefix-cache corruption immunity), plus the new in-tree DFlash high-concurrency fix (port of upstream PR #43982). Rollback tag: `:2026-06-11-pr41703` (vLLM 0.22.1 era). Earlier `:2026-06-04-pr44389` source pin was [`lesj0610/vllm@lesj/triton-nvfp4-kv-fork-20260602`](https://github.com/lesj0610/vllm/tree/lesj/triton-nvfp4-kv-fork-20260602) commit `e8c77b85`.
